# CS 682: Quantum Computing
This repository contains the programming assignments and paper presentation done in CS682A course in 2022-23 (Sem 1) under professor Dr. Rajat Mittal
### 1. Introduction to Qiskit
Qiskit is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits and algorithms.
* Create circuits like swap, CNOT etc, and its visualization
* Running their simulation using state-vector simulator
* Creating entangled state, superposition and measuring the qubits
### 2. Implementation of Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
### 3. Built QFT circuit for 3 qubits
### 3. Report & presentation for qPCP Conjucture
